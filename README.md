Our group developed a simple interactive forum and website related to various aspects of
climate crisis and climate change. The forum contains multiple categories and subcategories to which a user
can add their own new topics or reply and debate the topics posted by other users. Our website contains a
user account management system, including a password reset feature. Users can login to view their posts,
comment on other posts and also have the option to edit their own profile. The profile section includes
number of posts and replies, options to upload a profile picture, add a bio, country of residence and other
details. Our website also contains a top posts page, showing the top 3 most popular posts. We have included
live weather statistics, a live traffic congestion map, climate change twitter feed and various other features.
